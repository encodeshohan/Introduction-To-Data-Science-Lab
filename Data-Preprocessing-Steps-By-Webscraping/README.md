# Text Data Preprocessing for NLP

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on developing a comprehensive and efficient text data preprocessing pipeline to enhance the performance of natural language processing (NLP) models. Preprocessing text data is a crucial step in NLP projects as it involves cleaning, transforming, and structuring raw text into a format that models can effectively interpret and learn from.

## 💂️ Dataset Description
This project extracts text data from an online movie database using web scraping techniques. The dataset includes the following attributes:

- **Movie Title**: Name of the movie
- **Quality**: Video quality (HD, CAM, etc.)
- **Release Year**: Year of movie release
- **Duration**: Length of the movie
- **Type**: Category (TV Series or Movie)

## 🔧 Preprocessing Steps
✔ **Web Scraping**: Extracts text data from online sources. <br>
✔ **Text Cleaning**: Removes unwanted characters and noise from the text.<br>
✔ **Tokenization**: Splits text into meaningful units (tokens).<br>
✔ **Normalization**: Standardizes text formats.<br>
✔ **Stop Words Removal**: Eliminates commonly used words that add little value.<br>
✔ **Stemming and Lemmatization**: Reduces words to their root forms.<br>
✔ **Handling Contractions**: Expands shortened words.<br>
✔ **Handling Emojis and Emoticons**: Converts emojis and emoticons to text.<br>
✔ **Spell Checking**: Detects and corrects spelling errors.

## 📚 Technologies Used
- **R Language**
- **Libraries**: `rvest`, `dplyr`, `stringr`, `tokenizers`, `textstem`, `openxlsx`

## 📊 Key Results
- Successfully extracted and cleaned movie dataset.
- Text data is structured and formatted for NLP applications.
- Tokenization and lemmatization improve text analysis.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Implement Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Sentiment Analysis.
- Develop a recommendation system based on text data.
- Integrate with machine learning models for further text classification.
